  abstract={We propose LEO-Range, a novel physical layer design for secure ranging between Low Earth Orbiting ( LEO) satellites and devices. LEO-Range 1) is compatible with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM ) modulation scheme which is widely used by high-bandwidth satellite communications, 2) it provides accurate distance measurements (within the limits imposed by the available bandwidth) , and 3) it is provably secure and reliable across a range of common satellite channels. The design is based on a novel verification scheme in the frequency domain. We provide a security proof that bounds the probability of a distance-reduction attack for arbitrary physical layer attack strategies. We implement a prototype of LEO-Range and we test it with a hardware satellite channel emulator. In common line of sight 3GPP channels with SNRs between 8.8dB and 12dB (worst case scenario at low elevation) in a single ranging from a single satellite the adversary has a probability of less than 2−20 to successfully reduce the LEO-Range measured distance by more than 117 meters. These results already significantly limit spoofing, which typically can be done even across continents, and if distances are measured consecutively and from different satellites or ground stations, the overall distance and location spoofing will be even further limited, pointing to the practical viability of LEO-Range.}

  abstract={In this paper, we propose GNSS-WASP, a novel wide-area spoofing attack carried by a constellation of strategically-located synchronized transmitters. Unlike known attacks, which are constrained by the attacker's ability to track victim receivers, GNSS-WASP manipulates the positions measured by all the receivers in a target area without knowing the victim's positions. This allows GNSS-WASP to spoof a swarm of victims to another location while preserving their true formation (i.e., their relative distances). This opens the possibility of advanced attacks that divert entire fleets of vehicles and drones in a large area without the need to track specific victims. As such, GNSS-WASP bypasses state-of-the-art spoofing countermeasures that rely on constellations of receivers with known distances and those that rely on sudden, unpredictable movements for spoofing detection. While previous works discuss the stringent requirements for perfect spoofing of multiple receivers at known fixed locations, GNSS-WASP demonstrates how to spoof any number of moving receivers at unknown positions in a large area with an error that can remain hidden behind the legitimate noise. In addition to extensive simulations, we implement a prototype of GNSS-WASP with off-the-shelf software-defined radios and evaluate it on real GNSS receivers. Despite the error introduced by the proposed attack, GNSS-WASP can successfully spoof two receivers while maintaining their relative distance with an average error of 0.97 m for locations 1000 m away from the reference position. Finally, we also highlight possible countermeasures.}

  abstract={High-Rate Pulse (HRP) Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology is used for
            secure distance measurement and was standardized by IEEE 802.15.4z in 2020. This
            standard is currently implemented in chips deployed in consumer devices such as Apple
            iPhones and Samsung smartphones. However, due to the use of proprietary algorithms
            and closed implementation, evaluating the security of such chips analytically is
            challenging. In this work, we therefore investigate how to evaluate the security
            of HRP UWB chips empirically. We propose FAST, a generic and efficient testing
            methodology that we use to accurately characterize the security of HRP UWB chips
            against distance reduction attacks. FAST relies on importance sampling and can
            accurately estimate very low success rates, for example, much
            smaller than $2^{-10}$,
            using a small and practical number of tests. Using FAST, we characterize the security
            of a Qorvo DWM3000EVB chip across different settings and attack conditions. FAST
            revealed that different chip configurations affect the success rates
            ($2^{−10}$ to $2^{−128}$)
            and that a well-designed attack signal can bypass the additional consistency checks
            offered by the chip.}

            contactless payments are vulnerable to relay attacks that enable
            attackers to execute fraudulent payments. A number of
            countermeasures have been proposed to address this issue, including
            Mastercard’s relay protection mechanism. These countermeasures,
            although effective against some Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
            relays, fail to prevent physical-layer relay attacks. In this work,
            we leverage the Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) radios incorporated in major
            smartphones, smartwatches, tags and accessories, and introduce PURE,
            the first UWB-based relay protection that integrates smoothly into
            existing contactless payment standards, and prevents even the most
            sophisticated physical layer attacks. PURE extends EMV payment
            protocols that are executed between cards and terminals, and does
            not require any modification to the backend of the issuer, acquirer,
            or payment network. PURE further tailors UWB ranging to the payment
            environment (i.e., wireless channels) to achieve both reliability
            and resistance to all known physical-layer distance reduction
            attacks against UWB 802.15.4z. We implement PURE within the EMV
            standard on modern smartphones, and evaluate its performance in a
            realistic deployment. Our experiments show that PURE provides a
            sub-meter relay protection with minimal execution overhead (41 ms).
            We formally verify the security of PURE’s integration within

  abstract={A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a message-based protocol for
            intra-vehicle communication designed mainly with robustness and
            safety in mind. In real-world deployments, CAN bus does not offer
            common security features such as message authentication. Due to the
            fact that automotive suppliers need to guarantee interoperability,
            most manufacturers rely on a decade-old standard (ISO 11898) and
            changing the format by introducing MACs is impractical. Research has
            therefore suggested to address this lack of authentication with CAN
            bus Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that augment the bus with
            separate modules. IDSs attribute messages to the respective sender
            by measuring physical-layer features of the transmitted frame. Those
            features are based on timings, voltage levels, transients and, as of
            recently, Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) measurements. In this
            work, we show that TDoA-based approaches presented in prior art are
            vulnerable to novel spoofing and poisoning attacks. We describe how
            those proposals can be fixed and present our own method called
            EdgeTDC. Unlike existing methods, EdgeTDC does not rely on
            Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with high sampling rate and high
            dynamic range to capture the signals at sample level granularity.
            Our method uses time-to-digital converters (TDCs) to detect the
            edges and measure their timings. Despite being inexpensive to
            implement, TDCs offer low latency, high location precision and the
            ability to measure every single edge (rising and falling) in a
            frame. Measuring each edge makes analog sampling redundant and
            allows the calculation of statistics that can even detect tampering
            with parts of a message. Through extensive experimentation, we show
            that EdgeTDC can successfully thwart masquerading attacks in the CAN
            system of modern vehicles.}

            of the rank and a confidence interval. Its bounds rapidly become
            tight for increasing sample size, with a corresponding linear
            increase of the execution time. When applied to evaluate an AES-128

  abstract={Electronic devices generate electromagnetic noise, also known as EM
            leakage when the noise leaks information. Many recent research
            papers exploit the fact that software activity can exploit this
            leakage to generate radio signals. This process breaks the isolation
            between simple unprivileged code and the radio spectrum, letting an
            attacker generate physical radio signals without accessing any radio
            interface. Previous work has discovered many leakage sources and
            covert communication channels, which generally use simple modulation
            schemes. However, a fundamental research question has been left
            unexplored: to which point can attackers shape electromagnetic
            leakage into signals of their choice? The answer to this question
            has an important security impact that goes beyond specific attacks
            or platforms. Indeed, arbitrary signal modulation is a useful
            primitive. This would allow attackers to use advanced modulations
            and better exploit the channel (leakage) capacity, for example, to
            establish advanced communication channels, or to inject malicious
            signals into victim receivers. At a first analysis, arbitrary
            modulation seems impossible: software has limited control on the
            leakage and existing attacks are therefore constrained to on-off
            keying or frequency-shift keying. In this paper, we demonstrate that
            shaping arbitrary signals out of electromagnetic noise is possible
            from unprivileged software. For this we leverage fully-digital radio
            techniques and call our method Noise-SDR because, similarly to a
            software-defined radio, it can transmit a generic signal synthesized
            in software. We demonstrate our approach with a practical
            implementation with DRAM accesses on ARMv7-A, ARMv8-A, x86-64, and
            MIPS32. We evaluate it on different types of devices, including
            smartphones, a laptop, a desktop, and a Linux-based IoT device.
            Although power, frequency and bandwidth are constrained by the
            properties of the leakage, we present several case studies,
            including transmission with advanced protocols, device tracking, and
            signal injection.}

            embedded systems often use a mixed-signal chip that contains both
            a microcontroller and a transceiver. The physical proximity between
            digital blocks, which are strong sources of electromagnetic noise,
            and radio transceivers, which are sensitive to such noise, can cause
            functional and performance problems. Indeed, there exist many noise

            In this thesis we explore the security issues that arise from the

  abstract={Recently, some wireless devices have been found vulnerable to a
            novel class of side-channel attacks, called Screaming Channels.
            These leaks might appear if the sensitive leaks from the processor
            are unintentionally broadcast by a radio transmitter placed on the
            same chip. Previous work focuses on identifying the root causes, and
            on mounting an attack at a distance considerably larger than the one
            achievable with conventional electromagnetic side channels, which
            was demonstrated in the low-noise environment of an anechoic
            chamber. However, a detailed understanding of the leak, attacks that
            take full advantage of the novel vector, and security evaluations in
            more practical scenarios are still missing. In this paper, we
            conduct a thorough experimental analysis of the peculiar properties
            of Screaming Channels. For example, we learn about the coexistence
            of intended and unintended data, the role of distance and other
            parameters on the strength of the leak, the distortion of the
            leakmodel, and the portability of the profiles. With such insights,
            we build better attacks. We profile a device connected via cable
            with 10000·500 traces. Then, 5 months later, we attack a different
            instance at 15m in an office environment. We recover the AES-128 key
            with 5000·1000 traces and key enumeration up to $2^{23}$. Leveraging
            spatial diversity, we mount some attacks in the presence of
            obstacles. As a first example of application to a real system, we
            show a proof-of-concept attack against the authentication method of
            Google Eddystone beacons. On the one side, this work lowers the bar
            for more realistic attacks, highlighting the importance of the novel
            attack vector. On the other side, it provides a broader security
            evaluation of the leaks, helping the defender and radio designers to
            evaluate risk, and the need of countermeasures.}

  abstract={This paper presents a new side channel that affects mixed-signal
            chips used in widespread wireless communication protocols, such as
            Bluetooth and WiFi. This increasingly common type of chip includes
            the radio transceiver along with digital logic on the same
            integrated circuit. In such systems, the radio transmitter may
            unintentionally broadcast sensitive information from hardware
            cryptographic components or software executing on the CPU. The
            well-known electromagnetic (EM) leakage from digital logic is
            inadvertently mixed with the radio carrier, which is amplified and
            then transmitted by the antenna. We call the resulting leak
            screaming channels. Attacks exploiting such a side channel may
            succeed over a much longer distance than attacks exploiting usual EM
            side channels. The root of the problem is that mixed-signal chips
            include both digital circuits and analog circuits on the same
            silicon die in close physical proximity. While processing data, the
            digital circuits on these chips generate noise, which can be picked
            up by noise-sensitive analog radio components, ultimately leading to
            leakage of sensitive information. We investigate the physical
            reasons behind the channel, we measure it on several popular devices
            from different vendors (including Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832, and
            Qualcomm Atheros AR9271), and we demonstrate a complete key recovery
            attack against the nRF52832 chip. In particular, we retrieve the
            full key from the AES-128 implementation in tinyAES at a distance of
            10 m using template attacks. Additionally, we recover the key used
            by the AES-128 implementation in mbedTLS at a distance of 1 m with a
            correlation attack. Screaming channel attacks change the threat
            models of devices with mixed-signal chips, as those devices are now
            vulnerable from a distance. More specifically, we argue that
            protections against side channels (such as masking or hiding) need
            to be used on this class of devices. Finally, chips implementing
            other widespread protocols (e.g., 4G/LTE, RFID) need to be inspected
            to determine whether they are vulnerable to screaming channel
            attacks.}

  abstract={Connected embedded systems are becoming widely deployed, and their
            security is a serious concern. Current techniques for security
            testing of embedded software rely either on source code or on
            binaries. Detecting vulnerabilities by testing binary code is
            harder, because source code semantics are lost. Unfortunately, in
            embedded systems, high-level source code (C/C++) is often mixed with
            hand-written assembly, which cannot be directly handled by current
            source-based tools.
            In this paper we introduce Inception, a framework to perform
            security testing of complete real-world embedded firmware. Inception
            introduces novel techniques for symbolic execution in embedded
            systems. In particular, Inception Translator generates and merges
            LLVM bitcode from high-level source code, hand-written assembly,
            binary libraries, and part of the processor hardware behavior. This
            design reduces differences with real execution as well as the manual
            effort. The source code semantics are preserved, improving the
            effectiveness of security checks. Inception Symbolic Virtual
            Machine, based on KLEE, performs symbolic execution, using several
            strategies to handle different levels of memory abstractions,
            interaction with peripherals, and interrupts. Finally, the Inception
            Debugger is a high-performance JTAG debugger which performs
            redirection of memory accesses to the real hardware.
            We first validate our implementation using 53000 tests comparing
            Inception's execution to concrete execution on an Arm Cortex-M3
            chip. We then show Inception's advantages on a benchmark made of
            1624 synthetic vulnerable programs, four real-world open source and
            industrial applications, and 19 demos. We discovered eight crashes
            and two previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating the
            effectiveness of Inception as a tool to assist embedded device
            firmware testing.}
